# <span style="font-size: 18pt;">Telco Churn Factors</span>

**Product Description**

The Telco churn dataframe has many characteristics of customers that I was curious about whether there was any effect on whether a customer kept services or left. I was surprised at some of the factors that did or did not have an effect on whether a customer kept services.

**Initial Thoughts**

I am curious to look into how gender and age affect the buying patterns and retention rate of subscriptions, also how prices affect retention rates.

**Project Goal**

To delve into the data and see if what I am predicting will line up with information in the datasets.

**Plan**
1. Acquire data
2. Prepare data
3. Explore data
4. Model data
